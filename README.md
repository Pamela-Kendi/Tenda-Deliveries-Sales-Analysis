# Tenda Deliveries Sales Analysis
## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive end-to-end analytics pipeline for a mid-sized delivery company, fully developed in Microsoft Excel. Starting from raw data, I performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, before building an interactive dashboard that allows users to monitor performance and uncover insights at a glance.

The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where quick, accurate, and dynamic reporting is needed to guide decision-making. By leveraging advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables, Slicers, and charts, I transformed static spreadsheets into a decision-support tool.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

The sales dashboard revealed that Fruits & Vegetables, and Snack Foods dominate revenue, contributing the largest share of the companyâ€™s total sales. Performance peaked in 2018 before declining and stabilizing, signaling potential external or operational factors worth investigating. Urban outlets led sales, while medium and large outlet sizes generated nearly 80% of total revenue, underscoring their strategic importance.

Supermarkets emerged as the strongest outlet type, far outpacing convenience and grocery stores. Meanwhile, low-performing categories such as Seafood and Pet Supplies present opportunities for product rationalization or targeted promotions. Overall, the analysis highlights clear paths for growth: focus on bestsellers, strengthen high-performing outlets, expand urban market dominance, and investigate sales downturns to sustain long-term profitability.
