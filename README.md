# Tenda Deliveries Sales Analysis
## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive end-to-end analytics pipeline for a mid-sized delivery company, fully developed in Microsoft Excel. Starting from raw data, I performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, before building an interactive dashboard that allows users to monitor performance and uncover insights at a glance.

The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where quick, accurate, and dynamic reporting is needed to guide decision-making. By leveraging advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables, Slicers, and charts, I transformed static spreadsheets into a decision-support tool.
